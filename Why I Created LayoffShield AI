## 🎯 Why I Created LayoffShield AI

### The Problem I Wanted to Solve

In today’s job market, layoffs are often sudden and unpredictable. Most professionals only react **after** they lose their jobs. There is no early warning system that helps individuals understand whether they are at risk and what they can do **before** a layoff happens.

Having personally experienced repeated rejections and uncertainty in the job market, I wanted to build something practical — not just a model that predicts layoffs, but a system that helps people **prepare, adapt, and protect their careers**.

## 🚀 Ambition & Long-Term Vision

The ambition behind LayoffShield AI is to act as a **career risk intelligence system**.

My long-term vision is to evolve this project into:

* A tool that continuously evaluates layoff risk across industries
* A platform that guides professionals on **what skills to learn next**
* A system that helps people stay employable instead of reacting to job loss

LayoffShield is not meant to predict fear — it is meant to enable **preparedness and control**.
